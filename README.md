Work on applying deep learning to automatic theorem proving. 

Relevant papers and references:
 - ["DeepMath - Deep Sequence Models for Premise Selection"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04442) applies character- and word-levle CNNs and RNNs to selecting input axioms useful for proving a theorem
 - ["Premise Selection for Theorem Proving by Deep Graph Embedding"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.09994) does premise selection similar to DeepMath but with a better (graph-based model)
 - ["Reinforcement Learning of Theorem Proving"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07563) trains value and policy models for RL threorem proving
 - ["CS590: Deep Learning for Symbolic Reasoning"](https://tiarkrompf.github.io/cs590/2018/) is a Purdue class on this topic
